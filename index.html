        <h2>About Grassroots Medical Response</h2>
          <p> Grassroots Medical Response is an organization that provides free emergency response trainings in Portland, OR. The goal of these trainings is to enable community members to provide first aid. Calling 911 frequently does not result in prompt medical care for communities of color and in underserved areas of the city. By training communities in first aid, these medical needs can be met without the cost of an ambulance and the risk of involving police.</p>
